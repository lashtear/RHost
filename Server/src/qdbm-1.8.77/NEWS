Compressing options of ZLIB was changed.  If you use villa with the option
`VL_OZCOMP', databases of the earlier versions are not compatible with the
current version of QDBM.  To convert the old database to new format,
export endian independent data by "vlmgr exportdb" with the old version,
and then import it by "vlmgr importdb" with the latest version.

API of B+ tree was changed a bit.  Even if you build QDBM with ZLIB
enabled, records are not compressed.  Instead of it, the function `vlopen'
has the option `VL_OZCOMP'.  If it is specified, records are compressed.
So, you can switch whether to compress records or not, on runtime.

Users who have used ZLIB feature should modify their source codes to
specify that option.

The database format was changed with QDBM 1.7.13.  Newer versions do not
have backward compatibility to old format.  You can convert old databases
with the command `fmtcnv031127' in the sub directory `lab'.  To build it,
perform the following steps.

  cd lab
  make fmtcnv031127

About usage of it, see the file `README' in `lab'.  Typically, to convert
a Depot database named as `old' and create a database named as `new',
perform the following step.

  ./fmtcnv031127 < old > new

I'm sorry for bothering you.
