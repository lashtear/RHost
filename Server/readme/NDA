 1) I agree, to not give out the code, in part or in full, in any form of
    medium, to anyone or anything not previously allowed by the developers.

 2) I agree, to not let others look at the code, in part or in full, in
    any form of medium, to anyone or anything not previously allowed by the
    developers.

 3) I am aware that any modifications I make to the code is _FULLY_
    permitted, and that I do _NOT_ have to return said patches to the
    developers.

          ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Note: The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly
          look at adding them to the main distro if we see others would like
          it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
          you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
          rules are kept.
