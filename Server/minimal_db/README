All .txt files must be mkindx'd.
The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db
This is a minimal db with basic 'features' built in.


Steps:

1) copy the netrhost.conf file into the games directory
2) make any relevant changes you wish
3) db_load the flatfile
   - go into the game directory
   - type: ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new
4) Startmush as expected
