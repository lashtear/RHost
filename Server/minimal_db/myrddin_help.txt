   Expanded Help on Message Timeouts for Myrddin's Bulletin Board (1 of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's only a couple of things that need to be understood in order to take
full advantage of message timeouts.
  
1: Once a day, the TR_TIMEOUT attribute on the bbpocket should be triggered.
   Some games already have a way of accomplishing this. For games that do not,
   simply have a wizard execute set the 'autotimeout' global parameter:
      +bbconfig autotimeout=on
   Turning that parameter on sets up the board to take care of its own daily
   triggering.  Setting the paramenter to 'off' turns off the BBS's internal
   triggering.

   Expanded Help on Message Timeouts for Myrddin's Bulletin Board (2 of 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2: There are 3 different timeout values:
  
   The global parameter 'timeout' (set via the '+bbconfig timeout=<days>'
   command) sets a default timeout that will be set on any new bb groups
   created after the execution of this command.
  
   The group parameter 'timeout' (set via the '+bbconfig <#>/timeout=<days>'
   command) sets a default timeout for the group <#>. Any new messages
   posted to this group will inherit that timeout.
  
   The user command '+bbtimeout <group>/<message list>=<days>' will set the
   specified timeout on individual messages. Players can only modify their
   own messages, wizards can modify any messages. Players can only set
   timeouts equal to or less than the default timeout for the board, wizards
   can set any timeout.
  
   In all cases, a timeout of '0' indicates no timeout.

& bblock
==============================================================================
           Expanded Help on Group Locks for Myrddin's Bulletin Board
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few notes about locking BB Groups.
  
The +bblock/+bbwritelock commands are only meant to take care of the simplest
of locks.  There is simply no way to write one bblock'ing command that can
deal with all the different ways people want to lock their BB Groups, and it
certainly isn't practical to keep adding different locking commands for each
locking method I come across.
  
Coders can set up locks on Groups that are as customized or exotic as you like
quite easily, however.  Each Group has its own object.  If you look inside
the global BBS object, you'll see them.  Each Group object has a pair of
attributes that control who may read and who may write to that Group.  The
attributes are named CANREAD and CANWRITE, respectively.  The dbref of the
player attempting to read/write is passed to the appropriate attribute as %0.
As long as the attribute returns a non-zero result, the player can read/write.
  
CANREAD Examples:
   CANREAD: 1                               Anyone can read
   CANREAD: hasflag(%0,wizard)              Only wizards can read
   CANREAD: strmatch(name(%0),*z*)          Only characters with a 'z' in
                                              their name can read
==============================================================================

& bbconfig
==============================================================================
          Configuration Parameters for Myrddin's Bulletin Board 4.0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two types of configuration parameters: global and group.  Global
configuration parameters affect the BB system as a whole, while group 
configuration parameters affect a single Group.
To set a global parameter:
  
     +bbconfig <param>=<value>       Sets global config parameter.
  
Global Parameters:
  
     timeout            This sets the default timeout (in days) for any new
                          groups created. A timeout of '0' means messages
                          won't timeout. (ex. +bbconfig timeout=30)
     autotimeout        If you don't have a way to trigger the TR_TIMEOUT
                          attribute on the bbpocket (daily) to clean out
                          expired messages, you can use the autotimeout param
                          instead. Setting this param 'on' enables the BB's
                          built in timer. Set this param to 'off' to disable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See '+shelp bbconfig2' for info on Group parameters
==============================================================================

& bbconfig2
==============================================================================
          Configuration Parameters for Myrddin's Bulletin Board 4.0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set a Group parameter:
  
     +bbconfig <#>/<param>=<value>   Sets config parameter for board <#>.
  
Group Parameters:
  
     anonymous          Setting this value turns the Group 'anonymous'.  This
                          means that any future posting's 'Author' field will
                          have the value of this param instead of the name of
                          the author. Wizards will also see the actual name of
                          author.  (examples:
                          +bbconfig newspaper/anonymous=NewsPaper Staff,
                          +bbconfig house rules/anonymous=The Staff)
     timeout            Sets the default timeout value for the Group.  Any new
                          messages will have this new value.  A value of '0'
                          means messages won't timeout.
