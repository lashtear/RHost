The makefile will 'make' the program that will STOP the mush.
Please tweek 'autolog.h' with the proper parameters.


The 'startup.sh' will START the mush.


Both of these are intended to be used for automations (automated processes)
like your rc.local file and/or startup scripts when you bring your server up.
