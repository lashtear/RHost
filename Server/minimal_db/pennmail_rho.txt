@MAIL
  @mail[/<switches>] [<msg-list> [= <target>]]
  @mail[/<switches>] <player-list> = [<subject>/]<message>
 
  @mail invokes the built-in MUSH mailer, which allows players to send
  and receive mail. Pronoun/function substitution is performed on
  any messages you may try to send.  
 
  A <msg-list> is one of the following:
        A single msg # (ex: 3)
        A message range (ex: 2-5, -7, 3-)

	(unsupported)
        A folder number and message number/range (ex: 0:3, 1:2-5, 2:-7)

        A sender (ex: *paul)

	(unsupported)
        An age of mail in days (ex: ~3 (exactly 3), <2, >1)
           "days" here means 24-hour periods from the current time.

	(Use 'O'(read), 'B'(both unread and new), 'M'(marked), 'S'(safe))
        One of the following: "read", "unread", "cleared", "tagged",
        "urgent", "all" (all messages in all folders), "folder" (all
        messages in current folder)
  A <player-list> is a space-separated list of recipients, which may be:
        Player names
        Player dbref #'s
        Message #'s, in which case you send to the sender of that message.
        An alias name (see help @malias)

& mail-sending
MAIL-SENDING 
  @mail[/switch] <player-list> = [<subject>]/<msg>
        This sends the message <msg> to all players in <player-list>.
        If no subject is given, the message subject is the beginning
        of the message itself.
        All function substitutions are valid in <msg> including mail(#) which
        will allow you to forward mail you have received to other users.
        The following switches are available:
                /send   - same as no switch
                /urgent - mail is marked as "Urgent"

		(unsupported - both below)
                /silent - no notification to sender that mail was sent
                /nosig  - no mail signature
        If you have an @mailsignature attribute set on yourself, its
        contents will be evaluated and appended to the message unless
        the /nosig switch is given.
 
  @mail/fwd <msg-list> = <player-list>
        This sends a copy of all the messages in <msg-list> to
        all the players in <player-list>. The copy will appear to have
        been sent by you (not the original sender), and its status will
        be "Forwarded".
 

& mail-reading
MAIL-READING
 
  @mail <msg #>
  @mail/read <msg-list>
        This displays messages which match the msg# or msg-list from
        your current folder.
  
  @mail
  @mail <msg-list, but not a single msg #> 
  @mail/list <msg-list>
        This gives a brief list of all mail in the current folder,
        with sender name, time sent, and message status.
        The status field is a set of characters (ex: NC-UF+) which mean:
                N = New (unread) message
                C = Cleared message
                U = Urgent message
                F = Forwarded message
                + = Tagged message
        The opposites of these (read messages, etc.) are indicated with a
        '-' in the status field in that position.
        
& mail-folders
MAIL-FOLDERS
  The MUSH mail system allows each player 16 folders, numbered from
  0 to 15. Mail can only be in 1 folder at a time. Folder 0 is
  the "inbox" where new mail is received. Most @mail commands
  operate on only the current folder.
  (actually, you can have unlimited folders, but they're named, not numbered)
 
  @mail/folder
        This commands lists all folders which contain mail, telling
        how many messages are in each, and what the current folder is.
 
  @mail/folder <folder#|foldername>
        This command sets your current folder to <folder#>.
 
  (not supported.  They always have names)
  @mail/folder <folder#> = <foldername>
        This command gives <folder#> a name. 
 
  @mail/unfolder <folder#|foldername>
        This command removes a folder's name
 
  @mail/file <msg-list>=<folder#>
        This command moves all messages in msg-list from the current
        folder to a new folder, <folder#>.

& mail-other
MAIL-OTHER
  @mail/clear [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/unclear [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands mark mail in the current folder as cleared or uncleared.
        Mail marked for clearing is deleted when you disconnect, or
        if you use @mail/purge. If no msg-list is specified, all
        mail in your current folder is cleared. If "all" is given instead
        of a msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is cleared/uncleared.
  
  @mail/purge
        Actually deletes all messages marked for clearing with @mail/clear.
        This is done automatically when you log out.
 
  (Following two not supported)
  @mail/tag [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/untag [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands tag or untag mail in the current folder.
        Tagged mail can be later acted on en masse by using "tagged" as
        the msg-list for other commands (which does *not* untag them
        afterward). If no msg-list is specified, all messages in the
        current folder are tagged/untagged. If "all" is given as the
        msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is tagged/untagged.
        (Ex: To clear all mail from Paul and Chani, @mail/tag *paul,
        @mail/tag *chani, @mail/clear tagged, @mail/untag all).

& mail-admin
MAIL-ADMIN
  
  The @mail command can also take the following switches:
  
    @mail/stats [<player>]    --  Basic mail statistics.
    @mail/dstats [<player>]   --  Also provides read/unread count.
    @mail/fstats [<player>]   --  Does all that, plus gives space usage.
  
    @mail/debug <action>[=<player>]
    @mail/nuke
  
  Only wizards may stats players other than themselves. The mail statistics
  commands are computationally expensive, and thus are subject to "daytime"
  restrictions. They also cost the same as a @find (100 pennies).
  
  The /debug switch does sanity checking on the mail database, and may only
  be used by a wizard. "@mail/debug sanity" just does the check; the command
  "@mail/debug clear=<player name or dbref number>" wipes mail for an object.
  "@mail/debug fix" attempts to repair problems noted in the sanity check.
 
  The /nuke switch destroys the post office, erasing all @mail everywhere.  
  It may only be used by God.
