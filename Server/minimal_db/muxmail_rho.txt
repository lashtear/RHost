  @mail[/<switches>] <player-list> = <subject>
  @mail[/<switches>] [<msg-list> [= <target>]]
 
  @mail invokes the built-in MUX mailer, which allows players to send
  and receive mail. Pronoun/function substitution is performed on
  any messages you may try to send.
 
  A <player-list> is a space-separated list of recipients, which may be:
        Player names (names with spaces in them should be put in double
                      quotes, ex: "Foo Bar")
        Player dbref #'s
        Message numbers to be replied to.
        A mix of the above, and mail aliases (see @malias)
 
  A <msg-list> is one of the following:
        A single msg # (ex: 3)
        A message range (ex: 2-5, -7, 3-)
        A sender (ex: *lauren)
        An age of mail in days (ex: ~3 (exactly 3), <2, >1)
           "days" here means 24-hour periods from the current time.
        One of the following: "read", "unread", "cleared", "tagged", "urgent"
        For certain commands, "all".

& mail-sending
  @mail[/switch] <player-list> = <subject>
        This begins a message to all players in <player-list>.
        -<text> adds text to the message in progress, for example
                -This is a test
        would add the text 'This is a test' to the end of your @mail
        message, likewise, ~<text> prepends the text.

  @mail/send
        This sends the message that is currently in progress.
        -- is the equivalent of @mail/send. @mail/urgent sends
        the message as urgent, and should not be used often.
 
  @mail/cc <player-list>
        This replaces the currect player list with a new one for carbon
        copying. It does _not_ add onto the existing list.
 
  See mail-sending2.
 
& mail-sending2
  @mail/proof
        This shows you the message that is currently in progress, as
        it would be read by whomever received it.
  
  @mail/edit <old text> = <new text>
        Like @edit, but edits the message in process.

  @mail/abort
        This aborts the message currently in progress, allowing you
        to start a new one.
 
  @mail/fwd <msg> = <player-list>
        This sends a copy of <msg> to all the players in <player-list>.
        The copy will appear to have been sent by you (not the original
        sender), and its status will be "Forwarded". Note that this places
        the message to be forwarded into your mail buffer, where you can
        edit it with @mail/edit, add text with '-', or prepend text with
        '~'. You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
 
  @mail/quick <player-list>/<subject> = <message>
        Sends <message> to the list of players.
  

& mail-admin
  The @mail command can also take the following switches:
 
    @mail/stats [<player>]    --  Basic mail statistics.
    @mail/dstats [<player>]   --  Also provides read/unread count.
    @mail/fstats [<player>]   --  Does all that, plus gives space usage.
 
    @mail/debug <action>[=<player>]
    @mail/nuke
 
  Only wizards may stats players other than themselves. The mail statistics
  commands are computationally expensive, and thus are subject to "daytime"
  restrictions. They also cost the same as a @find (100 credits).
 
  The /debug switch does sanity checking on the mail database, and may only
  be used by a wizard. "@mail/debug sanity" just does the check; the command
  "@mail/debug clear=<player name or dbref number>" wipes mail for an object.
  "@mail/debug fix" attempts to repair problems noted in the sanity check.
 
  The /nuke switch destroys the post office, erasing all @mail everywhere.
  It may only be used by a wizard.
 
  Also, admin may set the @amail attrib on their char.  When somebody sends
  you mail, it will trigger that attrib if it exists.
 
& mail-reading
  @mail <msg #>
  @mail/read <msg-list>
        This displays messages which match the msg# or msg-list from
        your current folder.
 
  @mail
  @mail <msg-list, but not a single msg #>
        This gives a brief list of all mail in the current folder,
        with sender name, a list of receiving players, subject, and
        message status.
  @mail/list [<msg-list>]
        This gives the same list, but with time sent instead of subject.
        The status field is a set of characters (ex: NC-UF+) which mean:
                N = New (unread) message
                C = Cleared message
                U = Urgent message
                F = Forwarded message
                + = Tagged message
        The opposites of these (read messages, etc.) are indicated with a
        '-' in the status field in that position.
 

& @malias
  Command: @malias
  
  This allows you to generate and maintain mailing lists with the mail
  system. All mail aliases start with '*', and are case-sensitive. (*dir is
  different than *Dir).  There are two kinds of mail aliases, Personnal
  and Global. Global mailing lists are owned and maintained by the god (#1)
  char and are available for anyone to use.  Generally there will be
  *Wizards, *Admin, *Roleplay, and things of that nature.  Personal mailing
  aliases are mailing lists that you have defined with the @malias commad.
  Currently there is no limit to the number of people you can have on a
  mailing alias.
 
  To begin sending mail to a mailing list, use @mail *<alias>=subject.
  
  Usage:
  
  @malias                   Displays a list of all mail aliases.
  @malias *<alias>          Displays a list of people on that alias.
  @malias *<alias>=<list>   Creates that mailing list, using <list>.
  
  For more help, see the following help topics.  All errors can be
  sent to *Bugs, or Lauren.
 
{ 'help @malias2' for more }
 
& @malias2
  You can add, remove, rename, chown, redescribe, and delete mailing lists
  with a switch.
  
  @malias/remove *<alias>=<player>     Removes <player> from *<alias>.
  @malias/desc *<alias>=<description>  Changes the description for *<alias>. 
  @malias/add *<alias>=<player>        Adds <player> to *<alias>.
  @malias/rename *<alias>=<name>       Renames that alias. Names must always
                                       begin with '*'.
  @malias/delete *<alias>              Deletes <alias>.
  @malias/chown *<alias>=<player>      Changes the owner of <alias> to
                                       <player>.
 
  Wizards can use all of the malias commands on any mail alias. Instead of
  trying to figure out different mailing lists with the same name, wizards
  may use #<MALIAS NUMBER> instead of *alias in regards to the command.
  Remember that the alias commands will only recognize aliases owned by #1,
  owned by you, or by number.
  
  @malias/list                         When invoked by a wizard, it will
                                       list all mailing aliases currently
                                       defined by their number.
 
& mail-folders
  @mail/folder
        This commands lists all folders which contain mail, telling
        how many messages are in each, and what the current folder is.
 
  @mail/folder <folder#|foldername>
        This command sets your current folder to <folder#>.
 
(unsupported)
  @mail/folder <folder#> = <foldername>
        This command gives <folder#> a name.
 
  @mail/file <msg-list>=<folder#>
        This command moves all messages in msg-list from the current
        folder to a new folder, <folder#>.
   
& mail-reviewing
  @mail/review <player>
        Reviews the messages you have sent to <player>.
 
  @mail/review <player>=<msglist>
        Reads the messages you have sent to <player>.
 
  @mail/retract <player>=<msglist>
        Retracts (deletes) unread messages you have sent to <player>.
 
& mail-other
  @mail/clear [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/unclear [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands mark mail in the current folder as cleared or uncleared.
        Mail marked for clearing is deleted when you disconnect, or
        if you use @mail/purge. If no msg-list is specified, all
        mail in your current folder is cleared. If "all" is given instead
        of a msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is cleared/uncleared.
 
  @mail/purge
        Actually deletes all messages marked for clearing with @mail/clear.
        This is done automatically when you log out.

(unsupported) 
  @mail/tag [<msg-list | all>]
(unsupported) 
  @mail/untag [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands tag or untag mail in the current folder.
        Tagged mail can be later acted on en masse by using "tagged" as
        the msg-list for other commands (which does *not* untag them
        afterward). If no msg-list is specified, all messages in the
        current folder are tagged/untagged. If "all" is given as the
        msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is tagged/untagged.
        (Ex: To clear all mail from Lauren and Crusade, @mail/tag *lauren,
        @mail/tag *crusade, @mail/clear tagged, @mail/untag all).
 
{ 'help mail-other2' for more }
 
& mail-other2
  @mail/safe [<msg-list> | all>]
        This command marks a message as being safe from mail expiration. It
        should be used sparingly and only for very imporatant messages.
 
& mail-examples
  Here is an example of mailing a player, where is the player will be "bob",
  and sending the mail.
 
  > @mail bob = The MUX              - This is the Subject line. 
 
  Sending mail to player 'Bob'
  > -Hi bob.                         - This is where you will enter the body
                                       of the message.
  Text Added.
  > @send                            - Basically, sends the @mail.
 
  MAIL: You sent your message to 'Bob'.
