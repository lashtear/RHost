This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush
to a new site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do
this you would type the following:

                  cc portmsg.c -o portmsg

if 'cc' is not defined, try the following:

                 gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg

Once compiled, you would then modify the file 'file' to describe
the mush, what was done, where it's moved to, then specify the
IP address and the PORT where specified.

To launch the application, you would then type:

                 ./portmsg file <port>

Where <port> is the port where the mush used to run at.
