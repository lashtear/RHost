The rhost.cron file will be in the syntax as follows:

username (or dbref#)
command1;command2;command3;...;commandN
command
command
command1;command2;command3;...;commandN


You can have commands strung together with a semicolon
on the same line.  This counts as a single line of input.
You can have at most 20 lines of commands after the target
you wish to execute the commands as.  The target may
be a player name OR a dbref# of any valid dbref# within
the game.  Invalid targets will abort the cron process.
Non-printable characters in the cron file will abort
the process.  Any aborts or warnings will be logged
in the netrhost.gamelog.  

Here is a working example of the code cron file.
This example will perform dumps of the mush.
