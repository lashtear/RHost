a Web site. Supported file format are plain text and HTML. Supported
character encoding are US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1. The URI of each
document is specified with the path of its file. Attributes named as
\fItitle\fP and \fIdate\fP are given to each documents. When a document
is already existing in the database, it is registered if its last
modification time is newer, or it is ignored. Modification times are
stored in the sub database `_mtime' in the main database
directory. Score information are stored in the sub database `_score'
in the main database directory. This command is used in the above
format. \fIname\fP specifies a database name.  \fIdir\fP specifies a
directory name.
